@ path:		   path to you advanced style schemas
@ [5]:		   number of advanced stylesheets 
*/

$(function() {
var placeholder = $('#shell'),
      path = 'sc/';
 
style_switcher( placeholder, path, 5 );	
});
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
/* 
 [Multiple mode]

@ placeholder: DOM selector to append swicher menu 
@ group:               unical name of schema group
@ path:		   unical path to you schemas folder contains styles
@ [5]:		   number of stylesheets you want to switch
